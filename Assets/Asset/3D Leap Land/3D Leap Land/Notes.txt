Colors:
-------
Easily change the colors for all assets by modifying "palette.png" located in the "tex" folder.



Materials:
----------
For the sake of simplicity, all assets were developed using only 2 materials, metallic and non-metallic. Some models might contain both metallic and non-metallic elements. In such cases, the metallic material will always be the first slot and non-metallic second. Multiple materials only supported in the FBX versions.

Animations are done through blend-shapes, only supported in the FBX versions.
These are the models with blend-shapes:
- Water2 & Water4
